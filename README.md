Tureba's base configuration files
=================================

In order to use these files, you/I have to:

* place the repo in ~/.config/vim and get the submodules
* edit ~/.{bash,zsh}rc to source ~/.config/vim/{bash,zsh}rc after system stuff and before the local machine's specific configuration
* link ~/.toprc, ~/.inputrc, ~/.gitconfig and ~/.tmux.conf to the respective files in ~/.config/vim
* make sure the default XDG directories are there
* resource ~/.bashrc
* ????
* profit
