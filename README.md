Tureba's base configuration files
=================================

In order to use these files, you/I have to:

* place the repo in ~/.config/vim and get the submodules
* edit ~/.bashrc to source ~/.config/vim/bashrc after system stuff and before the local machine's specific configuration
* link ~/.toprc, ~/.inputrc and ~/.gitconfig to the rspective files in ~/.config/vim
* make sure the default XDG directories are there
* resource ~/.bashrc
* profit
